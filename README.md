## About this Repository
This is my submissions for the 8 weekly tasks due for the module Programming and Scripting.

These tasks are:

| Week | Title | Summary |
| :--  | :---: |  :---:  |
| 1 | Helloworld | Prints helloworld |
| 2 | Bank | Enter two numbers in cents, returns the sum in euro |
| 3 | Accounts | This program reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with x's). It will then accept a second number of any length and display the last 4 digits. |
| 4 | Collatz | This program will prompt the user to enter a positive integer and then prints the successive values of the following calculation:
at each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. The program will stop once it reaches 1. |
| 5 | Weekday | Is it a weekday or a weekend today? This program will tell you |
| 6 | Squareroot | This is a function that finds the approximated square-root of a given number. |
