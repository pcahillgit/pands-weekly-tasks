# Programming and Scripting Weekly Tasks

## About this Repository
This is my submissions for the 8 weekly tasks due for the module Programming and Scripting.

These tasks are:

| Week | Title | Summary |
| :--  | :---: |  :---:  |
| 1 | Helloworld | Prints helloworld. |
| 2 | Bank | Enter two numbers in cents, returns the sum in euro. |
| 3 | Accounts | This program reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with x's). It will then accept a second number of any length and display the last 4 digits. |
| 4 | Collatz | Prints the successive values of a calculation after a number is entered. |
| 5 | Weekday | Is it a weekday or the weekend today? This program will tell you. |
| 6 | Squareroot | This is a function that finds the approximated square-root of a given number. |
| 7 | Es | Choose a .txt document to submit as an argument on the command line and this program will count the number of e's within the document. |
| 8 | Plottask | Plots a normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2 along with function h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10. |
