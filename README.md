## About this Repository
This is my submissions for the 8 weekly tasks due for the module Programming and Scripting.

These tasks are:

| Week | Title | Summary |
| :--  | :---: |  :---:  |
| 1 | Helloworld | Prints helloworld. |
| 2 | Bank | Enter two numbers in cents, returns the sum in euro. |
| 3 | Accounts | This program reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with x's). It will then accept a second number of any length and display the last 4 digits. |
