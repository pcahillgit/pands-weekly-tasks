# Programming and Scripting Weekly Tasks

## About this Repository
This is my submissions for the 8 weekly tasks due for the module Programming and Scripting.

These tasks are:

| Week | Title | Summary |
| :--  | :---: |  :---:  |
| 1 | helloworld | Prints helloworld. |
| 2 | bank | Enter two numbers in cents, returns the sum in euro. |
| 3 | accounts | This program reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with x's). It will then accept a second number of any length and display the last 4 digits of that number. |
| 4 | collatz | Prints the successive values of a calculation after a number is entered. |
| 5 | weekday | Is it a weekday or the weekend today? This program will tell you. |
| 6 | squareroot | This is a function that finds the approximated square-root of a given number (by applying Newtons method of approximating squareroots). |
| 7 | es | Choose a .txt document to submit as an argument on the command line and this program will count the number of e's within the document. |
| 8 | plottask | Plots a normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2 along with function h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10. |

## Get Started
To try one of the python programmes above, I recommend you try them out on Visual Studio Code.

I used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to create and write these Python programmes and recommend you download and use the same to view the work.

Anaconda will pre-install Python along with any of the libraries used. Visual Studio Code is a tool which allows the user to view and edit code.

Once in the correct area of the repository in Visual Studio Code, just type python followed by the title of the task you would like to try out (ie. python helloworld.py) and it will run.

For week 7 you should also include a .txt doc after python es.py (if you don't you will just be asked to do this- exceptions are part of the assignment!).
